# Turbofuro
Visual programming langauge for building cool things in record time.

This repository contains the worker application, runtime and Turbofuro Expression Language (TEL).

Note: This project is in early development stage. We are working on the first public release. Stay tuned!

## Getting started
Download a latest release for your platform from the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/turbofuro/turbofuro/releases) or install the binary using `cargo install turbofuro_worker`. There is also an official [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/turbofuro/worker) you can use.

Once you have the binary you can run it with the following command:
```bash
turbofuro_worker --token <YOUR_MACHINE_TOKEN>
```
You can get your machine token from the machine details on [Turbofuro](https://turbofuro.com).

### Local development
This project contains a Cargo workspace with multiple crates. To build it locally, you need to install Rust and Cargo. You can do that by following the instructions on the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

After that, you can clone the repository and build the project with the following command:
```bash
cargo build --release
```
Once the build is completed you can use the `turbofuro_worker` binary in the `target/release` folder.

The turbofuro_worker project includes many examples of modules. You can run the test configuration with the following command:
```bash
cd turbofuro_worker
cargo run -- --config test_config.json
```
