Predictable expression language with familiar syntax. You can embed TEL in your application and evaluate user expressions in a safe way.

## Features
- Familiar C/Java/JavaScript like syntax
- Any JSON is a valid expression
- No object references  objects and arrays are compared by value (deep equality)
- Available to use on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tel)
- Compiles to WebAssembly and is available as [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@turbofuro/tel-wasm)
- Value and store (assignment like) expressions

## Getting Started
Download repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/turbofuro/turbofuro). You will find the TEL implementation in the `tel` folder. The `tel-wasm` folder contains the WebAssembly bindings.

### Building WebAssembly
Go to `tel-wasm` folder and run the following command:
```bash
wasm-pack build --scope turbofuro
```
The build will be in the `pkg` folder.

## Running example
There is also an Vite+React example of how to use WASM build in the `example` folder. You can run it with the following command:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Note: You need to build WASM before running the example.
